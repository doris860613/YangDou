Adapted from Eric Roberts's Breakout by
Sonja Johnson-Yu, Kylie Jue, Nick Bowman,
and Jerry Liao.

In this game, the player moves a paddle from side-to-side to hit a ball.
The gameâ€™s objective is to eliminate all of the bricks at the top of
the screen by hitting them with the ball.
But, if the ball falls to the bottom of the ground,
the player loses lives, and when there is no lives, the game ends!

To win the game, all the bricks must be eliminated.
